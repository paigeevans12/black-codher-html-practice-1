        <p>The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which
            belonged to <br>
            the Shinigami (To find out more about Shinigami's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinigami">Click
                Here</a>) Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is <br>written in
            its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a
            worldwide massacre of individuals<br>
            whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named
            "Kira", and the subsequent<br>
            efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him</p>
