        <h1>Death Note Fact Page</h1>
        <p>Death Note (stylized as DEATH NOTE) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. <br>
            The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to <br>
            the Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages.<br>
            The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals<br>
            whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent<br>
            efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him. Death Note ran in Shueisha's manga<br>
            magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in 12 tankōbon volumes.<br>
            A 37-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Madhouse and directed by Tetsurō Araki,  was broadcast in Japan on<br>
            Nippon Television from October 2006 to June 2007</p>
